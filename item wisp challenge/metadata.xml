    <description>In this challenge, any items you pick up that can be summoned by Lemegeton will be converted into item wisps. Protect them or lose them!

You'll start as Eden with random items. Choose your destination from the challenge menu (Mom, It Lives, Mother, Blue Baby, The Lamb, or Mega Satan).

Mod Config Menu provides some options:
[list]
    [*]Choose how the items converted into wisps will orbit the player. In 3 layers: like Lemegeton, but you're limited to 26 wisps. In 1 layer: up to 64 wisps. This only applies to new wisps.
    [*]Increase item wisp's health, up to 400%.
    [*]To make this a little more fair, you can choose to randomly receive a single-use Lemegeton in a consumable slot. It'll disappear once you leave the current room, so use it or lose it! The behavior is similar to the Dice Bag trinket.
    [*]You can also choose to auto-proc Lemegeton in Sacrifice Rooms or any time you take damage.
[/list]

Note: If you quit/continue then the 3 layers orbiting the player will turn into a single layer and allow you to bypass the wisp limit later on in your run. I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but it's how the game works.

Note: The Dice Bag trinket can override the single-use Lemegeton.
